# Mapping_Earthquakes Challenge

## Summary
The objective is to use Leaflet to create a map plotting earthquakes around the world. The data is collected through GeoJSON documents. The map features three layers:
- All earthquake data
- LineStrings for location of tectonic plates
- Major earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5

There are also three Mapbox tile sets used: Streets, Satellite, and Dark

### Dark Map - All Layers
